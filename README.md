# Powershell unzip application

This program creates a Powershell script that allows the user to unzip a selection of ``.ZIP`` files in a folder.

The user can then create a ``.RAR`` file from the unzipped folders. This saves the user from having to unzip each ``.ZIP`` file. It also compresses the files better than the .ZIP files.

## Process

Get the list of ``.ZIP`` files in the current folder.

Create the new Powershell script named ``unpack.ps1``.

Insert the list of .ZIP files into this script.

Run the script from the Powershell command line.
